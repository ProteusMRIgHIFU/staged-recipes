  summary: 'GPU/CPU 3D FDTD solution of viscoelastic equation'
  # The remaining entries in this section are optional, but recommended.
  description: |
    This tool solves in time domain the viscoelastic equation for wave propagation using an 
    staggered grid solution. The solution is primarily based on a paper from Virieux 
    (Virieux, J., 1986. P-SV wave propagation in heterogeneous media: Velocity-stress 
    finite-difference method. Geophysics, 51(4), pp.889-901.), who implemented for the first 
    time the staggered grid solution for the viscoelastic equation.
 
    While the underlying equations and methods were  developed primarily for seismic simulation, 
    the BabelViscoFDTD library was developed for biomedical applications to study the ultrasound 
    transmission through bone material, with skull bone as primary target for study.
    
    The name of the library comes from the fact this software may be one of the very few libraries 
    that support all modern backends for high-performance computing including CUDA, OpenCL and Metal.
